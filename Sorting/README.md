# Sorting

These are little simple sorting methods for std::vector. Mostly for learning C++

## Usage

For now just use header.h and file with sorting method you want. 

## Future changes

Merging it into one big program that would ask which sort to perform.

Using templates instead of simple integers.

Adding timer function to analyse which is fastest for given vector
