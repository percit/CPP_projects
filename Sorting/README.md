# Sorting

These are little simple sorting methods for std::vector. Mostly for learning C++

## Usage

For now just use header.h and file with sorting method you want. 

## Future changes

Changing it into one big program that would ask which sort to perform.

Using std::vector<T> instead of just std::vector<int>.

Adding times function to analyse which is fastest for given vector
